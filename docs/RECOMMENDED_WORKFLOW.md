# Recommended Workflow After Scanning

## 📋 Complete Workflow Overview

Here's the optimal workflow from scanning new files through to having clean, properly organized programs:

---

## Workflow Steps

### **Step 1: Scan Folder** 📂
**What:** Import new G-code files from external folders
**Where:** External tab → "Scan Folder" button
**Result:** Files added to database (marked as external, is_managed=0)

```
Example:
- Scanned folder: I:\My Drive\NC Master\REVISED PROGRAMS\
- Found: 150 new programs
- Added to database
- Duplicates handled with suffix (o12345 → o12345(1))
```

---

### **Step 2: Review Scan Results** 👀
**What:** Check what was imported
**Where:** External tab (shows all scanned files)
**Look for:**
- Any errors during scan
- Duplicate notices (programs with (1), (2) suffixes)
- Programs with missing data

**Optional:** Export stats to review quality

---

### **Step 3: Sync Registry** 🔄
**What:** Update program number registry with newly scanned programs
**Where:** Workflow tab → "🔄 Sync Registry" button
**Why:** Registry needs to know which program numbers are now in use

**How it works:**
- Click the button
- Confirm the operation
- Watch live progress window
- See completion summary

**Takes:** ~0.4 seconds
**Updates:** Marks scanned program numbers as IN_USE

**Alternative:** You can still run the command-line script if preferred:
```bash
python populate_registry.py
```

---

### **Step 4: Detect Round Sizes** 🎯
**What:** Detect round sizes for all programs
**Where:** Workflow tab → "🎯 Detect Round Sizes" button
**Why:** Needed to identify out-of-range programs

**How it works:**
- Click the button
- Confirm the operation
- Watch progress bar as it processes programs
- See real-time detection statistics
- View completion summary

**Results:**
- 92.4% detected from titles (HIGH confidence)
- 7.5% detected from G-code/dimensions (MEDIUM/LOW confidence)
- 0.1% need manual input

**Updates:** Programs table with round_size, confidence, source, in_correct_range

**Alternative:** You can still run the command-line script if preferred:
```bash
python run_batch_detection.py
```

---

### **Step 5: Review Out-of-Range Programs** ⚠️
**What:** See which programs are in wrong ranges
**Where:** Repository tab → "⚠️ Out-of-Range Programs" button
**Shows:**
- Program number
- Detected round size
- Current range (wrong)
- Correct range (where it should be)

**Decision Point:**
- Small number (< 50): Can rename manually if desired
- Large number (> 50): Use batch rename

---

### **Step 6: Import to Repository (Optional)** 📥
**What:** Move files from external to repository
**When:** When you want managed files
**How:** External tab → Select files → "Add to Repository"

**What happens:**
- Files copied to repository folder
- is_managed flag set to 1
- Enables version control
- Enables rename operations

**Note:** You can skip this if you prefer to keep files external

---

### **Step 7: Manage Duplicates FIRST** 🔎
**What:** Consolidate duplicate programs BEFORE batch renaming
**Where:** Repository tab → "🔍 Manage Duplicates"
**Why First:** Prevents wasting program numbers renaming files you'll delete

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Must complete ALL 4 passes in this order BEFORE batch rename!**

---

### **Pass 1: Delete Type 2 & 3 (Content Duplicates)**

**Button:** "🗑️ Delete Content Duplicates (Type 2 & 3)"

**Type 2 - Exact Duplicates:**
- **What:** Same name, same content (identical files)
- **Example:** `o12345` appears 3 times with identical content
- **Action:** Keep one (first/newest), delete the rest
- **Why First:** Easy to identify, no decision needed, clears most duplicates

**Type 3 - Content Duplicates:**
- **What:** Different names, same content
- **Example:** `o62000` and `o62500` have identical content
- **Action:** Keep the one in correct range, delete the other
- **Why:** Consolidates program numbers (one part = one number)
- **Benefit:** If o62500 is already in correct range, delete o62000 instead of renaming it!

**How to use:**
1. Click "🔍 Manage Duplicates" button
2. Click "🗑️ Delete Content Duplicates (Type 2 & 3)" button
3. Review the list of duplicates
4. Select which files to keep (mark with ✓)
5. Click "Delete Selected Duplicates"
6. Confirm deletion

**Result:** Only unique files remain (same content = same program)

---

### **Pass 2: Review Type 1 (Name Conflicts)**

**Button:** "✏️ Rename Name Duplicates (Type 1)"

**Type 1 - Name Conflicts:**
- **What:** Same name, different content (versions/revisions)
- **Example:** `o12345`, `o12345(1)`, `o12345(2)` with different dimensions
- **Action:** Review each, keep current version, delete old versions
- **Why:** Requires human judgment to determine correct version

**How to use:**
1. Still in "🔍 Manage Duplicates" window
2. Review groups of files with same base number but different suffixes
3. **Option A: Delete old versions manually**
   - Compare files (dimensions, dates, etc.)
   - Keep correct/current version
   - Delete outdated versions
   - Close window
4. **Option B: Use Rename button (if keeping multiple versions)**
   - Click "✏️ Rename Name Duplicates" button
   - Keeps first file (o12345)
   - Renames duplicates to available numbers in correct ranges:
     - o12345(1) with 8.5" round → o85000
     - o12345(2) with 6.25" round → o62501
   - Useful if you need to keep all versions

**Result:** No more name conflicts, each version has unique program number

---

### **Pass 3: Fix Underscore Suffixes (Cleanup)**

**Button:** "🔧 Fix Underscore Suffix Files"

**What:** Files with underscore/parenthesis suffixes that remain after Pass 1 & 2
- **Example:** `o12345_1.nc`, `o12345_2.nc`, `o62000(1).nc`
- **Problem:** Invalid program number format, not detected as out-of-range
- **Action:** Rename to available numbers in correct ranges

**How to use:**
1. Still in "🔍 Manage Duplicates" window
2. Scroll to STEP 3: Fix Underscore Suffixes
3. Click "🔧 Fix Underscore Suffix Files" button
4. Review preview showing old → new mappings:
   - `o12345_1` (8.5") → `o85000`
   - `o12345_2` (8.5") → `o85001`
   - `o62000(1)` (6.25") → `o62501`
5. Click "✓ Confirm Rename" to proceed
6. Watch progress as files are renamed

**Result:** All files have valid program numbers (o##### format)

---

### **Summary: Complete Duplicate Management Workflow**

**Execute in this order:**

```
Click "🔍 Manage Duplicates" button
   ↓
PASS 1: Delete Content Duplicates (Type 2 & 3)
   → Click "🗑️ Delete Content Duplicates" button
   → Review and delete identical files
   → Keep one per unique content
   ↓
PASS 2: Handle Name Conflicts (Type 1)
   → Review files with (1), (2) suffixes
   → Delete old versions OR use "✏️ Rename Name Duplicates" to keep all
   ↓
PASS 3: Fix Underscore Suffixes
   → Click "🔧 Fix Underscore Suffix Files" button
   → Renames o12345_1.nc → o85000.nc
   ↓
RESULT: Clean, unique, valid program numbers ready for batch rename
```

**Why this order matters:**
- Pass 1 deletes most duplicates (Type 2 & 3)
- Pass 2 handles version conflicts (Type 1)
- Pass 3 cleans up any remaining invalid suffixes
- **Only then** should you batch rename out-of-range programs

**Impact Example:**
```
200 files scanned → 150 duplicates
Wrong order (rename first): Uses 180 program numbers, wastes 150
Right order (dedupe first): Uses only 50 program numbers, saves 130!
```

See [DUPLICATE_MANAGEMENT_ORDER.md](DUPLICATE_MANAGEMENT_ORDER.md) for detailed explanation.

### **Step 8: Batch Rename Out-of-Range Programs** 🔧
**What:** Automatically rename programs to correct ranges
**Where:** Repository tab → "🔧 Resolve Out-of-Range (Batch Rename)"
**Prerequisites:**
- Programs must be in repository (is_managed=1)
- **Duplicates already handled** (Step 7 completed, including underscore suffix fix)

**Workflow:**
1. **Preview First:**
   - Set limit (start with 10-50)
   - Click "Generate Preview"
   - Review old → new mappings
   - Export to CSV if desired

2. **Test Small Batch:**
   - Execute on 10 programs
   - Verify results
   - Check files have legacy comments
   - Check registry updated

3. **Scale Up:**
   - Increase to 100, then 500
   - Finally run on all remaining

**What happens per program:**
- Finds next available number in correct range
- Updates file content with new program number
- Adds legacy comment: `(RENAMED FROM O62000 ON 2025-12-02)`
- Updates database program_number
- Tracks legacy name in database
- Updates registry (old=AVAILABLE, new=IN_USE)
- Creates audit log entry

---

### **Step 9: Handle Remaining Issues** 🔍
**What:** Deal with programs that couldn't be auto-renamed
**Examples:**
- Invalid round sizes (6.4355, 7.2934)
- Full ranges (10.5" range)
- Programs with no round size detected

**Options:**
1. Manually assign round sizes
2. Use free ranges (o1000-o9999, o14000-o49999)
3. Keep as-is if external files

---

### **Step 10: Final Sync** ✅
**What:** Final registry update
**When:** After all renames and duplicates handled
**Where:** Workflow tab → "🔄 Sync Registry" button

**Result:** Registry perfectly in sync with database

---

## 📊 Simplified Quick Workflow

For most users, the minimal workflow is:

```
1. Scan Folder           (Files tab → Scan Folder)
   ↓
2. Sync Registry         (Workflow tab → 🔄 Sync Registry)
   ↓
3. Detect Round Sizes    (Workflow tab → 🎯 Detect Round Sizes)
   ↓
4. Add to Repository     (External tab → Add Selected)
   ↓
5. Manage Duplicates     (Repository tab → 🔍 Manage Duplicates) ⚠️ DO THIS FIRST!
   PASS 1: Delete content duplicates (🗑️ button)
   PASS 2: Review name conflicts (✏️ button or manual delete)
   PASS 3: Fix underscore suffixes (🔧 button)
   ↓
6. Batch Rename          (Repository tab → Resolve Out-of-Range)
   ↓
7. Done!
```

**All 7 steps can be done entirely in the UI - no command line needed!**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:**
- Step 5 (Manage Duplicates) must happen BEFORE Step 6 (Batch Rename)
- Complete ALL 3 passes in Step 5 (content duplicates, name conflicts, underscore suffixes)
- Skipping this wastes program numbers renaming files you'll delete!

## 🎯 Workflow Variations

### **For External Files Only (No Repository)**

```
1. Scan Folder
2. Sync Registry
3. Detect Round Sizes
4. Review stats and out-of-range list
5. Done (keep files external)
```

**Use Case:** Just want to catalog files, not manage them

---

### **For Repository Management**

```
1. Scan Folder
2. Sync Registry
3. Detect Round Sizes
4. Add to Repository
5. Manage Duplicates  ⚠️ Before renaming!
6. Batch Rename
7. Final Sync
```

**Use Case:** Full program number management with renames

**⚠️ Critical:** Always manage duplicates (step 5) BEFORE batch rename (step 6)!

---

### **For Quick Import Without Renames**

```
1. Scan Folder
2. Add to Repository
3. Done
```

**Use Case:** Files already have correct numbers, just importing

---

## 📅 Maintenance Workflow

### **Weekly/Monthly Maintenance**

1. **Scan new folders** for recent programs
2. **Sync registry** after scanning
3. **Detect round sizes** for new programs
4. **Review out-of-range** count trend
5. **Batch rename** when count gets high (>100)

### **Before Major Changes**

1. **Create database backup**
   ```bash
   # Use app's backup feature or manual copy
   ```
2. **Export registry stats** for baseline
3. **Make changes** (rename, delete, etc.)
4. **Verify results**
5. **Sync registry** if needed

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Tips

### **Post-Scan Workflow (All in UI)**

After scanning new files:
1. Click "🔄 Sync Registry" button (Workflow tab)
2. Click "🎯 Detect Round Sizes" button (Workflow tab)
3. Click "📊 Round Size Stats" to see results (Workflow tab)
4. Review out-of-range programs in Repository tab

**No scripts needed - everything is in the UI!**

### **Alternative: Command-Line Script (Optional)**

If you prefer automation, create `post_scan_workflow.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
echo === Post-Scan Workflow ===
echo.
echo Step 1: Syncing registry...
python populate_registry.py
echo.
echo Step 2: Detecting round sizes...
python run_batch_detection.py
echo.
echo === Workflow Complete ===
echo.
echo Next: Review out-of-range programs in the app
pause
```

**Usage:** Run this after every scan session (alternative to UI buttons)
